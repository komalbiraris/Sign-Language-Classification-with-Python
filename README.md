# Sign-Language-Classification-with-Python

• Gestures of Sign Language can be recognized in real time from a simple mobile
phone camera or webcam
• The hand tracking tool provided by Google MediaPipe is good enough to be
used for gesture recognition
• From best to worst, the movement changes detected by the AI are number of
hands, vertical vs horizontal movement and vertical vs vertical movement.
• Videos with higher shutter speed (more frames per second) work better.
• There is room for improvement on the AI, video augmentation and variety of
gestures.
• An additional AI is required to recognize sentences properly
